# Introduction-to-Innovation-in-Swift
Sample code repository for the course "Introduction to Innovation in Swift" on MOOC.

## Contributing Rules

- Contributions are limited to the lecturers __ONLY__, if you find a bug or possible improvement of the code, open an Issue.
- Use one folder for one sample project, the folder name should be named as `<course-range>_<project_name>`, eg. `32-35_catch_geometry`.
- Try to limit the number of multi-media files, such as audio, video, large images. And try __NOT__ to use Git LFS, as I'm running out of my free quota.
- Add thorough comment to your code!
